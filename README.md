The structure of the project is based on the ნგრხ data management system, I use rxjs methods, for the visual side of the project I used only Angular material, I make extensions with tailwins.css, but mainly I paid attention to the structure and logic of the code rather than the design, so this also applies to the interface of the project. I used პreetier and eslint to format the code. I use an algorithm by means of which I store the state in the URL and it maintains the state during refresh, I also added pagination and sorting to the project, and saving the state during refresh also applies to them. As for the photos, I use another API, and then I get them from the Json server as a link. I'm going to add other functionality that I haven't been able to do so that it will be more complete in the end.
